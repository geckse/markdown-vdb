# Team Sync — Feb 20, 2026

Attendees: Alex, Jane, Marcus, Priya

## Security Discussion

Decided to migrate from API keys to OAuth2 by Q3. Current API key system has no scoping — keys either have full access or none. OAuth2 gives us fine-grained scopes per client.

Action items:
- Jane: draft the OAuth2 scope taxonomy by March 1
- Marcus: evaluate Keycloak vs custom auth service
- Priya: audit current API key usage to identify which clients need which scopes

## Performance Review

The search service is hitting latency spikes during peak hours (p99 > 800ms). Marcus suspects it's Elasticsearch garbage collection pauses.

Proposed fixes:
- Increase ES heap size from 4GB to 8GB
- Move to G1GC garbage collector
- Add a caching layer (Redis) for frequent queries

Marcus will benchmark all three options by next Friday.

## Documentation Sprint

We're behind on docs. The API reference is out of date (still documents v1 endpoints) and there's no onboarding guide for new developers.

Plan:
- Jane will update the API reference to v2 this week
- Alex will write a "Getting Started" guide
- Everyone adds docstrings to their service's public functions

## Hiring Update

Two backend engineer candidates in final round. Priya is running the system design interviews next week. Focus areas: distributed systems experience and Kubernetes familiarity.

## Next Meeting

Thursday, Feb 26. Marcus will demo the search performance improvements.
